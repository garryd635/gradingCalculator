# The Grading Calculator

##Project Description
  Features:
  
    1.  Calculate an estimate of an overall grade in a course based off of Instructor's 
        assignment weight and assignments completed.
    2. Stores data using mongodb.
  
  Purpose:
  
      The purpose of the grading calculator is to allow students to be able to quickly 
    know the estimate of their overall grade in a class/course.  The grading calculator
    was created as an individual project for A100.
    
  
  Running the Project:
  
      The Grading Calculator is a meteor app that is already deployed.  To access it
    go to http://garrydominique.meteor.com
    
##Status:
  Current:
  
      Current the application is able to calculate grades based on weighted criteria.  There are inputs
    available to type in grade weights for the common assignment types like Homework and Exams, and two 
    inputs named 'other' to assigned grades to assignment types not listed.  There are also inputs to put the 
    names and grades for assignment types with grade weights that already exists.
    
      The application does not have a way of displaying grading weights and assignments that would be entered to allow 
    users to visibly see their grade weights and assignments before calculating them. 
  
  Next Steps:
  
      1. Implementing a way of generating a list of stored assignments.
      2. Have the assignments displayed
